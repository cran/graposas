Description: Graphical approach provides a useful framework for multiplicity adjustment in clinical trials with multiple endpoints. This package includes statistical methods to optimize sample size over initial weight and transition probability in a graphical approach under a common setting, which is to use marginal power for each endpoint in a trial design.
